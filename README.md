## About

### Origin
I got the idea to make this from Coding with Lewis who made a participated in making a program that automatically makes reddit tts videos and uploads them to TikTok.
While I am not at the level of coding, I wanted to make something similar, so I am attempting to automate another trend on tiktok: songs slowed or sped up.


### How to Use
1. Download Code
2. Run it
3. Open 127.0.0.0:5000 or whaterver host and port you set it to.
4. Upload a file ending in ".wav" using the file upload button.
5. You will be redirected to a page which has 3 variations: sped up, normal, and slowed down.
6. You can click on any of them to listen to it or download.

### Future Additions
1. Accept other audio files(mp3, ogg, etc.)
2. Set to custom speed rather than preset 1.5x and 0.5x
3. Add more editing features(reverb, reverse, change file type of download, convert to mp4, upload directly from page)
